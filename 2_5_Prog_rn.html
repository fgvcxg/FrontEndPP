                Beginners should work out in a way that gradually
                increases their endurance by running and gradually
                increasing their time and distance.
                <br>
                <br>
                You may be out of breath because it's your first time,
                but if you endure it and overcome it, you're a beginner,
                so I think your physical strength will increase quickly.

                Outside the beginner level, you should set your target
                based on the previous experiences and move on gradually.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since you have some confidence, you should take care not 
                to overdo it and go to injury.
                Also, you should upgrade yourself with a little more 
                time and money because running is before or already
                your daily routine.
