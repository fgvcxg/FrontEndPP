                This is a program for those who favour performance 
                aboce all. When I was always impressed by Olympic 
                gymnastics, their agility and feat of strength. 
                Without a training facility I decided I would teach 
                myself those moves and start strength training to support them.

                Rock The Bells is a 6-week kettlebell program with 
                everything you need to get strong and lean, There are 
                3 workouts per week for the first  two weeks. Each 
                workout has a watm-up, a strength, and a core section 
                designed to provide optimum result. This is followed 
                by a week of challenges designed to demonstrate your 
                newly-found strength. This cycle repeats with 
                progressions.

                This program was developed by Dr. Kyle Pierce for the 
                intermediate Olympic lifter looking to hit new max 
                totals in snatch and clean & jerk. It was developed 
                using Dr. Pierce`s research on block periodization ro 
                maximize your strength gains. Is is divided into 3 
                phases - phase 1, phases 2 and competition phase. This 
                program is based onthe spreadsheet shared on r/weightlifting wiki.
