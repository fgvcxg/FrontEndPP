                    In human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common 
                    usage, although academically the term specifically means the 
                    upper arm between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and 
                    the elbow joint. The distal part of the upper limb between the 
                    elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the 
                    forearm or "lower" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is 
                    the hand.

                    The arm is divided by a fascial layer (known as lateral and 
                    medial intermuscular septa) separating the muscles into two 
                    osteofascial compartments: the anterior and the posterior 
                    compartments of the arm. The fascia merges with the periosteum 
                    (outer bone layer) of the humerus.
                    <br>
                    The anterior compartment contains three muscles: biceps 
                    brachii, brachialis and coracobrachialis muscles. They are all 
                    innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. The posterior 
                    compartment contains only the triceps brachii muscle, supplied 
                    by the radial nerve.

                    <h4>
                        The biceps curl mainly targets the biceps brachii, brachialis 
                        and brachioradialis muscles. The biceps is stronger at elbow 
                        flexion when the forearm is supinated (palms turned upward) 
                        and weaker when the forearm is pronated. The brachioradialis 
                        is at its most effective when the palms are facing inward, 
                        and the brachialis is unaffected by forearm rotation. 
                        Therefore, the degree of forearm rotation affects the degree 
                        of muscle recruitment between the three muscles.

                        Lying triceps extensions, also known as skull crushers and 
                        French extensions or French presses, are a strength exercise 
                        used in many different forms of strength training. Lying 
                        triceps extensions are one of the most stimulating exercises 
                        to the entire triceps muscle group in the upper arm.
                        It works the triceps from the elbow all the way to the 
                        latissimus dorsi. Due to its full use of the Triceps 
                        muscle group, the lying triceps extensions are used by 
                        many as part of their training regimen.
