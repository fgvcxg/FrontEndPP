                    The human leg, in the general word sense, is the entire lower 
                    limb of the human body, including the foot, thigh or sometimes 
                    even the hip or gluteal region. However, the definition 
                    in human anatomy refers only to the section of the lower limb 
                    extending from the knee to the ankle, also known as the crus 
                    or, especially in non-technical use, the shank. Legs are 
                    used for standing, and all forms of locomotion including 
                    recreational such as dancing, and constitute a significant 
                    portion of a person's mass. Female legs generally have greater 
                    hip anteversion and tibiofemoral angles, but shorter femur 
                    and tibial lengths than those in males.

                    The muscles of the thigh can be classified into three groups 
                    according to their location: anterior and posterior muscles and 
                    the adductors (on the medial side). All the adductors except 
                    gracilis insert on the femur and act on the hip joint, and so 
                    functionally qualify as hip muscles. The majority of the thigh 
                    muscles, the "true" thigh muscles, insert on the leg (either 
                    the tibia or the fibula) and act primarily on the knee joint.         
                    Generally, the extensors lie on anterior of the thigh and flexors 
                    lie on the posterior. Even though the sartorius flexes the knee, 
                    it is ontogenetically considered an extensor since its displacement 
                    is secondary.

                        A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers 
                        their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. 
                        During the descent and knee joints flex while the ankle joint 
                        dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and 
                        the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up. Squats also 
                        help your hip muscles Squats are considered a vital exercise 
                        for increasing the strength and size of the lower body 
                        muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary 
                        agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps 
                        femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.

                        The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a 
                        loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the 
                        level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor, 
                        before being placed back on the ground. It is one of 
                        the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat 
                        and bench press.
