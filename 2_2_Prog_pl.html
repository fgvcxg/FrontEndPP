                This os a 9-week training approach for 
                beginner athletes designed to overcome many 
                shortcoings of common programs that beginner 
                powerlifters run. It`s the starting program we wish 
                we had before powerlifting, designed powerlifting, 
                designed to bridge into either repeat of the same 
                approach as long as you keep making progress, or 
                into more advanced training approaches as seamlessly 
                as possible.
